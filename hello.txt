GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, built around Git, allowing developers to host and review code.

It supports millions of open-source projects, enabling features like pull requests, issues tracking, and continuous integration.

Launched in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018, GitHub now powers over 420 million repositories worldwide.

Users can create public repositories for free or use private ones with paid plans, fostering team workflows and code reviews.
